1. Наверное, это самое сложное, догадаться (найти), как и где настроить S3, dynamodb и IAM-права в AWS. Поэтому 1-й пункт задания сложнее 2-го оказывается :)  
Это, что прописал в main.tf:

        terraform {
            backend "s3" {
                bucket = "at6man-terraform-states"
                encrypt = true
                key = "main-infra/terraform.tfstate"
                region = "me-south-1"
                dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
            }
        }

    PS C:\Users\Alex\PycharmProjects\netology.devops\devops-netology\terraform> terraform init

    Initializing the backend...

    use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

    Initializing provider plugins...
    - Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
    - Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v3.63.0

    Terraform has been successfully initialized!

    PS C:\Users\Alex\PycharmProjects\netology.devops\devops-netology\terraform> terraform workspace new stage

    Acquiring state lock. This may take a few moments...

    Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
    following symbols:
      + create
